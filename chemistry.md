## Chemistry Apps

I've never taught chemistry, but I've worked with some great chemistry teachers. These apps have been tested by many. 

### Virtual Labs/Phenomena
These replicate something like you would get with a hands on lab. Students can change things and see final velocities. 

[Air Pressure Paper](/airpressurepaper/) - **Chemistry/Physics** - Very simple simulation of air particles hitting a paper. Drag the right edge of the paper to change its size.  Measures the width of the paper and the number of hits per second. I once started the year with trying to flip a ruler with a single sheet of news paper on it. This simulation helped the students make sense of why the news paper is able to stop the ruler if it is flat but not if it is folded up. Text is huge because I used it on a projector as a whole class. 

[Mg HCl](/mghcl/) - **Chemistry** - Simulates HCl reacting with Mg. Shows the molecules and graphs of compound levels. I made this for a friend so I haven't used it personally, but it has been tested by a number of chemistry teachers.

[Light and Temperature](/lighttemp/) - **Chemistry/Physics** - Change the temperature of a black body. See the distribution of light by wavelength and see an approximation of the color. I have a version that shows the distribution by frequency too I could fix up if there is interest. 

[Rusting](/rusting/) - **Chemistry** - Simulates rusting at different temperatures and environments and for different shapes. Shows the molecules. I made this for a friend so I haven't used it personally, but It has been tested by a number of chemistry teachers. 

[Temperature Solids](/temperaturesolids/) - **Chemistry/Physics** - Simulates the movement of particles in two solids at different temperatures. You can change the size of each solid (number of particles) and starting temperature and you can drag them to touch or not touch. You see a graph of their temperature over time. I made this for a friend so I haven't used it personally, but It has been tested by a number of chemistry teachers. 

[Water Temperature](/watertemperature/) - **Chemistry** - Place a small beaker of water into a larger dish of water. Can control the initial temperatures and volumes. Shows the temperature over time. Can export data as csv. 

### Measurement or Problems

*None yet, but if you think of some that might be good, let me know.*

### Diagram Makers
Sometimes it's easier for me to make an app once rather than make 100 versions of a diagram.
