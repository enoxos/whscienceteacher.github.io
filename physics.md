## Physics Apps

Note: many [earth & space apps](/earthspace/) may be helpful in a physics class. 

### Virtual Labs/Phenomena
These replicate something like you would get with a hands on lab. Students can change things and see final velocities. 

[Air Pressure Paper](/airpressurepaper/) - **Chemistry/Physics** - Very simple simulation of air particles hitting a paper. Drag the right edge of the paper to change its size.  Measures the width of the paper and the number of hits per second. I once started the year with trying to flip a ruler with a single sheet of news paper on it. This simulation helped the students make sense of why the news paper is able to stop the ruler if it is flat but not if it is folded up.

[Ball on Ramp](/ballramp/) - **Physics** - A simple ball on a ramp. Drag to change the height and width of the ramp. I use this one to practice planning and carrying out investigations. I also have a version with friction that I use for my forces tests I will try to find. 

[Cannon](/cannon/) - **Physics** - Cannon that fires a ball. You can change the power of the cannon and the angle of fire. Students use a ruler to measure the range of the cannon and a stopwatch to measure air time. There is a fair amount of randomness so students can practice more of the skills in analyzing and interpreting data. 

[Cart and Pulley](/cartpulley/) - **Physics** - Cart attached to a string over a pulley with a weight on the end. It has basic directions on the screen. Also available  [without directions](/cartpulleynodirections).

[Collisions](/collisions/) - **Physics** - Change masses and initial velocities and measure final velocities.

[Elastic Energy](/elastic/) - **Physics** - Drag to stretch a rubber band. Shows the distance, force required, and elastic energy. I use this for practice describing patterns as linear and non-linear. 

[Electric Car](/electriccar/) - **Physics** - Is this useful to anyone? I don't know but I might as well put it here - You set the maximum speed of an electric car and watch the battery drain. I used it for my students to practice looking at linear and non linear relationships. It was part of a whole unit on electric cars. 

[Index of Refraction](/ior/) - **Physics** - How can you tell the difference between a real diamond and a fake? Use Snell's law of course. Practice on water, glass, and plastic then determine if your diamond sample is real or a fake. In this simulation you drag and rotate a laser, ruler, and protractor. 

[Light and Temperature](/lighttemp/) - **Chemistry/Physics** - Change the temperature of a black body. See the distribution of light by wavelength and see an approximation of the color. I have a version that shows the distribution by frequency too I could fix up if there is interest. 

[Measuring Gravity](/gravity/) - **Physics** - I normally do an activity where I drop a metal ball down a three flight stairwell and have students time it. I can't do that remotely so I will use this simulation. Students time a 10m drop and then can calculate g. They can then use that to calculate a greater distance.  

[Motion Graphs](/motiongraphs/ - **Physics** - Replicates an activity where you move in front of a motion detector and look at the position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I like to have students try and make interesting graphs and then have others replicate them. 

[Music Waves](/musicwaves/) - **Physics** - Keyboard that plays sounds and shows the wave on the screen. Can change the audio volume. Sound may not work on some old platforms. White keys only, black keys don't work. 

[Pull Cart](/pullcart/) - **Physics** - Push or pull on a cart through a spring. The app records force and acceleration and graphs them so students can figure out the mass is the slope. Can export the data as csv. 

[Roller Coaster Motion](/rollercoastermotion/) - **Physics** - Change the angle of the slope and initial of a roller coaster. Record and download position, velocities, and acceleration.

[Storms](/storms/) - **Physics** - Students change the temperature of the atmosphere and see the effect on clouds and wind. A very simplified version of a weather simulation. I used this as a summative assessment where students practiced finding patterns and then constructing explanations of why climate change causes more violent storms using ideas about kinetic and potential energy. 

[Temperature Solids](/temperaturesolids/) - **Chemistry/Physics** - Simulates the movement of particles in two solids at different temperatures. You can change the size of each solid (number of particles) and starting temperature and you can drag them to touch or not touch. You see a graph of their temperature over time. I made this for a friend so I haven't used it personally, but It has been tested by a number of chemistry teachers. 

[Wave Interference](/waveinterference/) - **Physics** - Change the wavelength and amplitude of two waves and see the resultant wave. The waves move so it looks like a real wave. 


### Measurement or Problems
Think of these as virtual practice problems. Students make measurements and calculate or figure something out. 

[Ants](/ants/) - **Physics** - Two ants run across the screen. Students use a ruler and stopwatch (included digitally) to find velocity and acceleration. It's like a physics problem but with a real moving object so all the quantities have meaning. There are many calculations that can be done of varying difficulty.

[cars](/cars/)  - **Physics** - Three cars of different colors drive along a road. Students can time them and use calculations to determine their velocities. I also have versions with accelerations if people are interested. 

[Measuring Gravity](/gravity/) - **Physics** - I normally do an activity where I drop a metal ball down a three flight stairwell and have students time it. I can't do that remotely so I will use this simulation. Students time a 10m drop and then can calculate g. They can then use that to calculate a greater distance. 

[Measuring g on Moons of Jupiter](/gonmoons/) - **Physics** - Students are given animations of a ball bouncing on four moons of Jupiter. They use a digital ruler and stopwatch to measure realistic values of g on each of the moons. I used it as a quiz where students were randomly assigned one of them and had to measure from the bottom to the top of the bounce and then calculate. 

[Motion Yes No](/motionyn/) - **Physics** - One of the hardest things for physics students is keeping a clear distinction between velocity and acceleration. This app helps by putting a moving object in front of them and asking, 'is there velocity?", "is there acceleration?", "is the velocity changing?", etc. This is very frustrating for the students, but I find it to be very helpful. I have many versions of this asking about different quantities and including the direction. There is even a test version if people find it helpful. Keeps track of number in a row.

[Wave Measurement Practice](/wavemprac/) - **Physics** - The app generates a graph of a wave on a grid. Students practice measuring wavelength, amplitude, and number of waves. The app checks if they are right and keeps track of how many they have in a row.  

### Diagram Makers
Sometimes it's easier for me to make an app once rather than make 100 versions of a diagram.

[Energy Bars](/energybars/) - **Physics** - Tiny app to make bar graphs of types of energy. Drag up and down in each bar. Double Tap the label at the top of a bar to remove it from the diagram. By default it shows kinetic (KE), potential (PE), chemical (CE), heat (HE), and total energy (TE). Hit save and it will download the image.

[Stick Figure](/stickfigure) - **Physics** - I use a lot of dynamic stick figures to illustrate a motion I am describing in writing. semi detailed stick figures with two-segment arms and legs can really help demonstrate what is happening. This app helps making them easier. 

[Two Wave Diagrams](/twowavediagrams/) - **Physics** - Combines two waves and saves a png of the result. Waves can be combined with AM, FM, or with simple interference. AM and FM support square waves. Can change the wavelength, amplitude, and phase of each wave. Wavelength and Amplitude are in pixel units. For phase 1=-90Â° for some reason.
