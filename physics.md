### Virtual Labs/Phenomena
These replicate something like you would get with a hands on lab. Students can change things and see final velocities. 

[Ball on Ramp](/ballramp/) - **Physics** - A simple ball on a ramp. Drag to change the height and width of the ramp. I use this one to practice planning and carrying out investigations. I also have a version with friction that I use for my forces tests I will try to find. 

[Cart and Pulley](/cartpulley/) - **Physics** - Cart attached to a string over a pulley with a weight on the end. It has basic directions on the screen. Also available  [without directions](/cartpulleynodirections/).

[Collisions](/collisions/) - **Physics** - Change masses and initial velocities and measure final velocities.

[Electric Car](/electriccar/) - **Physics** - Is this useful to anyone? I don't know but I might as well put it here - You set the maximum speed of an electric car and watch the battery drain. I used it for my students to practice looking at linear and non linear relationships. It was part of a whole unit on electric cars. 

[Index of Refraction](/ior/) - **Physics** - How can you tell the difference between a real diamond and a fake? Use Snell's law of course. Practice on water, glass, and plastic then determine if your diamond sample is real or a fake. In this simulation you drag and rotate a laser, ruler, and protractor. 

[Roller Coaster Motion](/rollercoastermotion/) - **Physics** - Change the angle of the slope and initial of a roller coaster. Record and download position, velocities, and acceleration.

[Wave Interference](/waveinterference/) - **Physics** - Change the wavelength and amplitude of two waves and see the resultant wave. The waves move so it looks like a real wave.
