## Physics Apps

### Virtual Labs/Phenomena
These replicate something like you would get with a hands on lab. Students can change things and see final velocities. 

[Ball on Ramp](/ballramp/) - **Physics** - A simple ball on a ramp. Drag to change the height and width of the ramp. I use this one to practice planning and carrying out investigations. I also have a version with friction that I use for my forces tests I will try to find. 

[Cart and Pulley](/cartpulley/) - **Physics** - Cart attached to a string over a pulley with a weight on the end. It has basic directions on the screen. Also available  [without directions](/cartpulleynodirections).

[Collisions](/collisions/) - **Physics** - Change masses and initial velocities and measure final velocities.

[Electric Car](/electriccar/) - **Physics** - Is this useful to anyone? I don't know but I might as well put it here - You set the maximum speed of an electric car and watch the battery drain. I used it for my students to practice looking at linear and non linear relationships. It was part of a whole unit on electric cars. 

[Index of Refraction](/ior/) - **Physics** - How can you tell the difference between a real diamond and a fake? Use Snell's law of course. Practice on water, glass, and plastic then determine if your diamond sample is real or a fake. In this simulation you drag and rotate a laser, ruler, and protractor. 

[Roller Coaster Motion](/rollercoastermotion/) - **Physics** - Change the angle of the slope and initial of a roller coaster. Record and download position, velocities, and acceleration.

[Wave Interference](/waveinterference/) - **Physics** - Change the wavelength and amplitude of two waves and see the resultant wave. The waves move so it looks like a real wave. 


### Measurement or Problems
Think of these as virtual practice problems. Students make measurements and calculate or figure something out. 

[Ants](/ants) - **Physics** - Two ants run across the screen. Students use a ruler and stopwatch (included digitally) to find velocity and acceleration. It's like a physics problem but with a real moving object so all the quantities have meaning. There are many calculations that can be done of varying difficulty.

[Measuring g on Moons of Jupiter](/gonmoons/) - **Physics** - Students are given animations of a ball bouncing on four moons of jupiter. They use a digital ruler and stopwatch to measure realistic values of g on each of the moons. I used it as a quiz where students were randomly assigned one of them and had to measure from the bottom to the top of the bounce and then calculate. 

[Motion Yes No](/motionyn/) - **Physics** - One of the hardest things for phsyics students is keeping a clear distinction between velocity and acceleration. This app helps by putting a moving object in front of them and asking, 'is there velocity?", "is there acceleration?", "is the velocity changing?", etc. This is very frustrating for the students, but I find it to be very helpful. I have many versions of this asking about different quantities and including the direction. There is even a test version if people find it helpful. Keeps track of number in a row.

### Diagram Makers
Sometimes it's easier for me to make an app once rather than make 100 versions of a diagram.

[Energy Bars](/energybars/) - **Physics** - Tiny app to make bar graphs of types of energy. Drag up and down in each bar. Double Tap the label at the top of a bar to remove it from the diagram. By default it shows kinetic (KE), potential (PE), chemical (CE), heat (HE), and total energy (TE). Hit save and it will download the image.
[Two Wave Diagrams](/twowavediagrams/) - **Physics** - Combines two waves and saves a png of the result. Waves can be combined with AM, FM, or with simple interfernce. AM and FM support square waves. Can change the wavelength, aplitude, and phase of each wave. Wavelength and Amplitude are in pixel units. For phase 1=-90Â° for some reason.
