## Welcome to my apps

This is a list of all the apps availible. They are sorted by content area and how you might use them. 

### Virtual Labs
These replicate something like you would get with a hands on lab. Students can change things and see final velocities. 
[Collisions](collisions/) - Change masses and initial velocities and measure final velocities.

[Roller Coaster Motion](rollercoastermotion/) - Change the angle of the slope and initial of a roller coaster. Record and download position, velocities, and acceleration.

### Measurement or Problems
Think of these as virtual practice problems. Students make measurements and calculate or figure something out. 

### Diagram Makers
Sometimes it's easier for me to make an app once rather than make 100 versions of a diagram.
