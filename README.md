## Welcome to my apps

### Who is the Wild Haired Science Teacher?
I'm a science teacher in the Chicago Public Schools. For the past 7 years, I've been making simple web apps for my own classroom. They have made three dimensional NGSS-style science teaching easier and everyday for my students; now I want everyone to benefit from them. 

The apps load on any web connected device and are free for everyone. Student's don't need an account or anything special to access. They just need to load a webpage. 

This is a list of all the apps available. 
The apps are sorted by content area and how you might use them. I want to help as many students as possible get a high-quality three-dimensional science education. The apps will always be free. If you find them useful, consider [donating to the Wild Haired Science Teacher on patreon](https://www.patreon.com/whscienceteacher). **You'll support development of more apps!**

### Virtual Labs/Phenomena
These replicate something like you would get with a hands on lab. Students can change things and see final velocities. 

[Air Pressure Paper](/airpressurepaper/) - **Chemistry/Physics** - Very simple simulation of air particles hitting a paper. Drag the right edge of the paper to change its size.  Measures the width of the paper and the number of hits per second. I once started the year with trying to flip a ruler with a single sheet of news paper on it. This simulation helped the students make sense of why the news paper is able to stop the ruler if it is flat but not if it is folded up. Text is huge because I used it on a projector as a whole class. 

[Bug In Meadow](/buginmeadow/) - **Biology** - Replicates the common Bead Bug activity. click/tap the bugs on a meadow to eat half of them. Click "count" to see how many of each color survived and then have them reproduce. After several generations you see strong selection pressure based on the colors in th meadow. This is one of the first I made so it looks janky but it works better than any actual beads and cloth version I've seen. 

[Onion Root Tip Slides](/onionroot/) - **Biology** - Shows onion root tip slides. Start with a macro picture of green onions and zoom in on two roots at 40x and 100-400x. Slides are chosen to show stages of mitosis clearly. Big thank you to [Berkshire Community College Bioscience Image Library](http://blogs.berkshirecc.edu/bccoer/) for releasing their microscopy photos in the public domain. 

[Heat Capacity](/heatcapacity/) - **Chemistry/Physics** - Heat or cool metal balls of different sizes and materials and put it in water to measure the change in water temperature. You can watch visually or export a data series as csv. 

[Light and Temperature](/lighttemp/) - **Chemistry/Physics** - Change the temperature of a black body. See the distribution of light by wavelength and see an approximation of the color. I have a version that shows the distribution by frequency too I could fix up if there is interest. 

[Mg HCl](/mghcl/) - **Chemistry** - Simulates HCl reacting with Mg. Shows the molecules and graphs of compound levels. I made this for a friend so I haven't used it personally, but it has been tested by a number of chemistry teachers.

[Rusting](/rusting/) - **Chemistry** - Simulates rusting at different temperatures and environments and for different shapes. Shows the molecules. I made this for a friend so I haven't used it personally, but It has been tested by a number of chemistry teachers. 

[Temperature Solids](/temperaturesolids/) - **Chemistry/Physics** - Simulates the movement of particles in two solids at different temperatures. You can change the size of each solid (number of particles) and starting temperature and you can drag them to touch or not touch. You see a graph of their temperature over time. I made this for a friend so I haven't used it personally, but It has been tested by a number of chemistry teachers. 

[Water Temperature](/watertemperature/) - **Chemistry** - Place a small beaker of water into a larger dish of water. Can control the initial temperatures and volumes. Shows the temperature over time. Can export data as csv. 

[Atmosphere](/atmosphere/) - **Earth & Space** - Simulation of light energy interacting with CO₂ in the atmosphere. Shows light of different wavelengths from the sun and infrared leaving. 

[Gravity Assist](/gravityassist/) - **Earth & Space** - Students can figure out the conditions for how a spacecraft can use the gravity from a planet to speed up or slow down. 

[ISS Orbit](/issorbit/) - **Earth & Space** - Change the velocity of the ISS to make it orbit the Earth. Helps with understanding how an orbit works.

[Orbit Examples 1](/orbit1/) - **Earth & Space** - Shows four orbits around the Earth including low earth, geostationary, and very elliptical. Good for finding patterns in orbits.

[Orbit Examples 2](/orbit2/) - **Earth & Space** - More examples of orbits. Shows a transfer orbit from a close to a far circular orbit. 

[Planet Energy](/planetenergy/) - **Earth & Space** - Shows the Earth and Mercury change temperature over time. Mercury is hotter during the day but colder at night. I used this phenomenon to start a unit about climate change. Also available as a version that shows photons entering and leaving the planet: [Planet Energy With Light](/plantenergywithlight/). Versions in °C: [Without Light](/planetenergyc/) and [with Light](/planetenergywithlightc/). You an also [change the location of the marker on Earth.](planetenergy/planetenergylocation.md)

[Ball on Ramp](/ballramp/) - **Physics** - A simple ball on a ramp. Drag to change the height and width of the ramp. I use this one to practice planning and carrying out investigations. Also available as a sliding [block with friction](/blockramp/) with fixed μ. There is some randomness in the values so students can practice using the analyzing and interpreting data practice. Also available in a version that [shows energy](/ballrampenergy/). **UPDATE FOR BUG FIX:** 2020-10-08 - The previous version of this app had a bug where high angles ramps had lowe accelerations due to an extra cos(θ) term. It's now fixed along with some minor visual improvements. Thank you to a user who pointed this out!

[Cannon](/cannon/) - **Physics** - Cannon that fires a ball. You can change the power of the cannon and the angle of fire. Students use a ruler to measure the range of the cannon and a stopwatch to measure air time. This version has a small amount of randomness in it so students can practice their analyzing and interpreting data but it doesn't stand in the way of seeing the patterns This version allows angles 10° to 40° so students see a simple increasing pattern. **Update: 2020-09-17** Now loads the right app. Also available with [high angles only (50° to 80°)](/cannon/full/) so students see a clear decreasing pattern and the [full range of angles(10° to 80°)](/cannon/full/). There is also a version with [more statistical noise](/cannon/noise/) and a full range of angles so students can focus on analyzing and interpreting data practice.

[Cart and Pulley](/cartpulley/) - **Physics** - Cart attached to a string over a pulley with a weight on the end. It has basic directions on the screen. Also available  [without directions](/cartpulleynodirections).

[Collisions](/collisions/) - **Physics** - Change masses and initial velocities and measure final velocities.

[Elastic Energy](/elastic/) - **Physics** - Drag to stretch a rubber band. Shows the distance, force required, and elastic energy. I use this for practice describing patterns as linear and non-linear. 

[Electric Car](/electriccar/) - **Physics** - Is this useful to anyone? I don't know but I might as well put it here - You set the maximum speed of an electric car and watch the battery drain. I used it for my students to practice looking at linear and non linear relationships. It was part of a whole unit on electric cars. 

[Heat Capacity](/heatcapacity/) - **Chemistry/Physics** - Heat or cool metal balls of different sizes and materials and put it in water to measure the change in water temperature. You can watch visually or export a data series as csv. 

[Index of Refraction](/ior/) - **Physics** - How can you tell the difference between a real diamond and a fake? Use Snell's law of course. Practice on water, glass, and plastic then determine if your diamond sample is real or a fake. In this simulation you drag and rotate a laser, ruler, and protractor. 

[Map Measure](/mapmeasure/) - **Physics/Earth&Space** - Shows a map or image overlain with a digital ruler. Students can drop waypoints to form a route on the map. You can add your own map using the image URL by adding #imageurl on the end. For example: [https://whscience.org/mapmeasure/#https://i.postimg.cc/sXGpff1M/image.png](https://whscience.org/mapmeasure/#https://i.postimg.cc/sXGpff1M/image.png). Not all image hosts allow sharing images this way so I suggest using postimage.org You need the direct link including the ".png" or ".jpg" on the end. 

[Measuring Gravity](/gravity/) - **Physics** - I normally do an activity where I drop a metal ball down a three flight stairwell and have students time it. I can't do that remotely so I will use this simulation. Students time a 10m drop and then can calculate g. They can then use that to calculate a greater distance.  

[Motion Graphs](/motiongraphs/) - **Physics** - Replicates an activity where you move in front of a motion detector and look at the position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I like to have students try and make interesting graphs and then have others replicate them. 

[Music Waves](/musicwaves/) - **Physics** - Keyboard that plays sounds and shows the wave on the screen. Can change the audio volume. Sound may not work on some old platforms. White keys only, black keys don't work. 

[Pendulum](/pendulum/) - **Physics** - Change the mass and string length of a pendulum and watch it swing. Height and velocity shown on screen. Students can measure the period by hand with a built in stopwatch. Data can be exported as csv. Also available [with damping](/pendulumdamped/) and in a [simpler version](/pendulumsimple/) without velocity and data export. 

[Pull Cart](/pullcart/) - **Physics** - Push or pull on a cart through a spring. The app records force and acceleration and graphs them so students can figure out the mass is the slope. Can export the data as csv. 

[Roller Coaster Motion](/rollercoastermotion/) - **Physics** - Change the angle of the slope and initial of a roller coaster. Record and download position, velocities, and acceleration. Also availible in a [version where the cart rolls back](/rollercoastermotionrollback/) if it stops on the hill. Also available as a [vertical roller coaster](/verticalrollercoaster/) that goes up at a constant speed and then falls. 

[Spaceship Programming](/spaceship/) - **Physics** - Program an unmanned spaceship by turning on and off thrusters to maneuver to a target. Very game like with missions. Helps students think about forces, especially what Newton's First Law means. Impulse is also implicit since thrusters need to be turned on for certain amounts of time.

[Storms](/storms/) - **Physics** - Students change the temperature of the atmosphere and see the effect on clouds and wind. A very simplified version of a weather simulation. I used this as a summative assessment where students practiced finding patterns and then constructing explanations of why climate change causes more violent storms using ideas about kinetic and potential energy. Also availible [in °C.](/stormsc/)

[Wave Combination](/wavecombination/) - **Lab/Phenomenon** - Students drag dots to form two (static) waves forms. The app shows what the combination would be if they were added. Also good for students making waves with different wavelengths/amplitudes.

[Wave Interference](/waveinterference/) - **Physics** - Change the wavelength and amplitude of two waves and see the resultant wave. The waves move so it looks like a real wave. 



### Measurement or Problems
Think of these as virtual practice problems. Students make measurements and calculate or figure something out. 

[Bacteria Plate Streaking](/streaking/) - **Biology** - Students practice the procedure of streaking a plate to isolate a bacteria culture. Heavy inspired by [this excellent simulation](http://learn.chm.msu.edu/vibl/content/streakplate.html) out of Michigan State University that unfortunately doesn't work well for remote learning because it requires  flash. A request of my wife's. 

[Gel and Restriction Enzymes](/gelre/) - **Biology** - An old request of my wife's - Two simulations. The first is using restriction enzymes without sticky ends. The second is moving DNA segments a la gel electrophoresis. Keeps track of how many you have done. 

[Transcription and Translation](/transcriptiontranslation/) - **Biology** - Move base pairs around to transcribe off an open DNA sequence and then act as tRNA and bring in the right amino acid using a chart. I'm going to be honest. This app is so old I don't really remember making it but I tested it out and it seems to work fine. 

[Ants](/ants/) - **Physics** - Two ants run across the screen. Students use a ruler and stopwatch (included digitally) to find velocity and acceleration. It's like a physics problem but with a real moving object so all the quantities have meaning. There are many calculations that can be done of varying difficulty. [Ants II](/antsii/) has students estimate initial and final velocity by using sets of lines close together to see which ant has a higher acceleration. Ants II is also available with the [opposite outcome](/antsii/ii/) incase you want different sections to get different results. [Ants III](/antsiii/) shows both ants with constant velocitie. Students can use them to measure distance or see which ant is faster. Ants III is also available with the [opposite result](/antsiii/iii/) in case you want different sections to get different results. 

[Cars](/cars/)  - **Physics** - Three cars of different colors drive along a road. Students can time them and use calculations to determine their velocities. This version has all constant speeds but they start at different places. 

[Cars II](/carsii/) - **Physics** - Three cars of different colors drive along a road. Students can time them and use calculations to determine their velocities. This version, one of the cars has acceleration. 

[Car Challenge](/carchallenge/) - **Physics** - Students take measurements and make calculations to determine if the car has a small acceleration or if it traveling at a constant speed. There is also a [second version](/carchallengeii/) with the alternative outcome. 

[Car Crash](/carcrash/) - **Physics** - Students figure out if a driver in a minor car crash is to blame. They check the driver's statements against recorded information, measurements, and calculations to judge if the driver is telling the truth. [This page](/carcrash/info.md) has the information I gave them.

[Measuring Gravity](/gravity/) - **Physics** - I normally do an activity where I drop a metal ball down a three flight stairwell and have students time it. I can't do that remotely so I will use this simulation. Students time a 10m drop and then can calculate g. They can then use that to calculate a greater distance. 

[Measuring g on Moons of Jupiter](/gonmoons/) - **Physics** - Students are given animations of a ball bouncing on four moons of Jupiter. They use a digital ruler and stopwatch to measure realistic values of g on each of the moons. I used it as a quiz where students were randomly assigned one of them and had to measure from the bottom to the top of the bounce and then calculate. 

[Motion Yes No](/motionyn/) - **Physics** - One of the hardest things for physics students is keeping a clear distinction between velocity and acceleration. This app helps by putting a moving object in front of them and asking, 'is there velocity?", "is there acceleration?", "is the velocity changing?", etc. This is very frustrating for the students, but I find it to be very helpful. I have many versions of this asking about different quantities and including the direction. There is even a test version if people find it helpful. Keeps track of number in a row.

[Wave Measurement Practice](/wavemprac/) - **Physics** - The app generates a graph of a wave on a grid. Students practice measuring wavelength, amplitude, and number of waves. The app checks if they are right and keeps track of how many they have in a row.  

### Diagram Makers
Sometimes it's easier for me to make an app once rather than make 100 versions of a diagram.

[Blood Pressure Diagram](/bpdiagram/) - **Biology** - A request of my wife's - Shows the dial on an analog sphygmomanometer. Can show systolic and diastolic side by side or on the same dial. Use a screenshot to save the image. (Win-PrtScn or Fn-Win-Space on Windows, Shift-Cmd-4 on Mac)

[Pedigree Maker](/pedigree/) - **Biology** - A request of my wife's - Make pedigree diagrams by dragging the pieces around. Double click to select a piece. Use a screenshot to save the image. (Win-PrtScn or Fn-Win-Space on Windows, Shift-Cmd-4 on Mac)

[Energy Bars](/energybars/) - **Physics** - Tiny app to make bar graphs of types of energy. Drag up and down in each bar. Double Tap the label at the top of a bar to remove it from the diagram. By default it shows kinetic (KE), potential (PE), chemical (CE), heat (HE), and total energy (TE). Hit save and it will download the image.

[Stick Figure](/stickfigure/) - **Physics** - I use a lot of dynamic stick figures to illustrate a motion I am describing in writing. semi detailed stick figures with two-segment arms and legs can really help demonstrate what is happening. This app helps making them easier. 

[Two Wave Diagrams](/twowavediagrams/) - **Physics** - Combines two waves and saves a png of the result. Waves can be combined with AM, FM, or with simple interference. AM and FM support square waves. Can change the wavelength, amplitude, and phase of each wave. Wavelength and Amplitude are in pixel units. For phase 1=-90° for some reason.

### Measurement Tools ###
[Spring Scale](/springscale/) - It's just a spring scale. You put brass weights on it of masses between 0.05 and 1 kg. I made it so my students could have mass and weight data without needing to know about g.
