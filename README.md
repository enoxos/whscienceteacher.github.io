## Welcome to my apps

### Who is the Wild Haired Science Teacher?
I'm a science teacher in the Chicago Public Schools. For the past 7 years I've been making simple web apps for my own classroom. They have made three dimensional NGSS-style science teaching easier and everyday for my students now I want everyone to benefit from them. 

The apps load on any web connected device and are free for everyone. Student's don't need an account or anything special to access. They just need to load a webpage. 

This is a list of all the apps available. They are sorted by content area and how you might use them. I want to help as many students as possible get a high-quality three-dimensional science education. The apps will always be free. If they help you, consider [supporting their ongoing development on patreon].(https://www.patreon.com/whscienceteacher)


### Virtual Labs
These replicate something like you would get with a hands on lab. Students can change things and see final velocities. 

[Collisions](./collisions/) - Change masses and initial velocities and measure final velocities.

[Roller Coaster Motion](./rollercoastermotion/) - Change the angle of the slope and initial of a roller coaster. Record and download position, velocities, and acceleration.

### Measurement or Problems
Think of these as virtual practice problems. Students make measurements and calculate or figure something out. 

### Diagram Makers
Sometimes it's easier for me to make an app once rather than make 100 versions of a diagram.
