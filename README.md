## Welcome to my apps

### Who is the Wild Haired Science Teacher?
I'm a science teacher in the Chicago Public Schools. For the past 7 years I've been making simple web apps for my own classroom. They have made three dimensional NGSS-style science teaching easier and everyday for my students now I want everyone to benefit from them. 

The apps load on any web connected device and are free for everyone. Student's don't need an account or anything special to access. They just need to load a webpage. 

This is a list of all the apps available. They are sorted by content area and how you might use them. I want to help as many students as possible get a high-quality three-dimensional science education. The apps will always be free. 


### Virtual Labs/Phenomena
These replicate something like you would get with a hands on lab. Students can change things and see final velocities. 

[Bug In Meadow](./buginmeadow/) - **Biology** - Replicates the common Bead Bug activity. click/tap the bugs on a meadow to eat half of them. Click "count" to see how many of each color survived and then have them reproduce. After several generations you see strong selection pressure based on the colors in th meadow. This is one of the first I made so it looks janky but it works better than any actual beads and cloth version I've seen. 

[Mg HCl](./mghcl/) - **Chemistry** - Simulates HCl reacting with Mg. Shows the molecules and graphs. I made this for a friend so I haven't used it personally, but It has been tested by a number of chemistry teachers.

[Rusting](./rusting/) - **Chemistry** - Simulates rusting at different temperatures and environments and for different shapes. Shows the molecules. I made this for a friend so I haven't used it personally, but It has been tested by a number of chemistry teachers. 

[Temperature Solids](./temperaturesolids) - **Chemistry** - Simulates the movement of particles in two solids at different temperatures. You can change the size of each solid (number of particles) and starting temperature and you can drag them to touch or not touch. You see a graph of their temperature over time. I made this for a friend so I haven't used it personally, but It has been tested by a number of chemistry teachers. 

[Cart and Pulley](./cartpulley) - **Physics** - Cart attached to a string over a pulley with a weight on the end. It has basic directions on the screen. Also available  [without directions](./cartpulleynodirections).

[Collisions](./collisions/) - **Physics** - Change masses and initial velocities and measure final velocities.

[Electric Car](./electriccar/) - **Physics** - Is this useful to anyone? I don't know but I might as well put it here - You set the maximum speed of an electric car and watch the battery drain. I used it for my students to practice looking at linear and non linear relationships. It was part of a whole unit on electric cars. 

[Index of Refraction](./ior/) - **Physics** - How can you tell the difference between a real diamond and a fake? Use Snell's law of course. Practice on water, glass, and plastic then determine if your diamond sample is real or a fake. In this simulation you drag and rotate a laser, ruler, and protractor. 

[Roller Coaster Motion](./rollercoastermotion/) - **Physics** - Change the angle of the slope and initial of a roller coaster. Record and download position, velocities, and acceleration.


### Measurement or Problems
Think of these as virtual practice problems. Students make measurements and calculate or figure something out. 

[Gel and Restriction Enzymes](./gelre/) - **Biology** - An old request of my wife's - Two simulations. The first is using restriction enzymes without sticky ends. The second is moving DNA segments a la gel electrophoresis. Keeps track of how many you have done. 

[Ants](./ants) - **Physics** - Two ants run across the screen. Students use a ruler and stopwatch (included digitally) to find velocity and acceleration. It's like a physics problem but with a real moving object so all the quantities have meaning. There are many calculations that can be done of varying difficulty.

[Motion Yes No](./motionyn) - **Physics** - One of the hardest things for phsyics students is keeping a clear distinction between velocity and acceleration. This app helps by putting a moving object in front of them and asking, 'is there velocity?", "is there acceleration?", "is the velocity changing?", etc. This is very frustrating for the students, but I find it to be very helpful. I have many versions of this asking about different quantities and including the direction. There is even a test version if people find it helpful. Keeps track of number in a row.

### Diagram Makers
Sometimes it's easier for me to make an app once rather than make 100 versions of a diagram.

[Blood Pressure Diagram](./bpdiagram/) - **Biology** - A request of my wife's - Shows the dial on an analog sphygmomanometer. Can show systolic and diastolic side by side or on the same dial. Use a screenshot to save the image. (Win-PrtScn or Fn-Win-Space on Windows, Shift-Cmd-4 on Mac)

[Pedigree Maker](./pedigree/) - **Biology** - A request of my wife's - Make pedigree diagrams by dragging the pieces around. Double click to select a piece. Use a screenshot to save the image. (Win-PrtScn or Fn-Win-Space on Windows, Shift-Cmd-4 on Mac)

[Energy Bars](./energybars/) - **Physics** - Tiny app to make bar graphs of types of energy. Drag up and down in each bar. Double Tap the label at the top of a bar to remove it from the diagram. By default it shows kinetic (KE), potential (PE), chemical (CE), heat (HE), and total energy (TE). Hit save and it will download the image.
