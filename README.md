## Welcome to my apps

### Who is the Wild Haired Science Teacher?
I'm a science teacher in the Chicago Public Schools. For the past 7 years I've been making simple web apps for my own classroom. They have made three dimensional NGSS-style science teaching easier and everyday for my students now I want everyone to benefit from them. 

The apps load on any web connected device and are free for everyone. Student's don't need an account or anything special to access. They just need to load a webpage. 

This is a list of all the apps available. They are sorted by content area and how you might use them. I want to help as many students as possible get a high-quality three-dimensional science education. The apps will always be free. If they help you, consider [supporting their ongoing development on patreon].(https://www.patreon.com/whscienceteacher)


### Virtual Labs/Phenomena
These replicate something like you would get with a hands on lab. Students can change things and see final velocities. 

[Cart and Pulley](./cartpulley) - **Physics** - Cart attached to a string over a pulley with a weight on the end. It has basic directions on the screen. Also availible [without directions](./cartpulleynodirections).

[Collisions](./collisions/) - **Physics** - Change masses and initial velocities and measure final velocities.

[Electric Car](./electriccar/) - **Physics** - Is this useful to anyone? I don't know but I might as well put it here - You set the maximum speed of an electric car and watch the battery drain. I used it for my students to practice looking at linear and non linear relationships. It was part of a whole unit on electric cars. 

[Index of Refraction](./ior/) - **Physics** - How can you tell the difference between a real diamond and a fake? Use Snell's law of course. Practice on water, glass, and plastic then determine if your diamond sample is real or a fake. In this simulation you drag and rotate a laser, ruler, and protractor. 

[Roller Coaster Motion](./rollercoastermotion/) - **Physcs** - Change the angle of the slope and initial of a roller coaster. Record and download position, velocities, and acceleration.

[Bug In Meadow](./buginmeadow/) - **Biology** - Replicates the common Bead Bug activity. click/tap the bugs on a meadow to eat half of them. Click "count" to see how many of each color survived and then have them reproduce. After several generations you see strong selection pressure based on the colors in th meadow. This is one of the first I made so it looks janky but it works better than any actual beads and cloth version I've seen. 

### Measurement or Problems
Think of these as virtual practice problems. Students make measurements and calculate or figure something out. 

### Diagram Makers
Sometimes it's easier for me to make an app once rather than make 100 versions of a diagram.

[Pedigree Maker](./pedigree/) - **Biology** - A request of my wife - Make pedigree diagrams by dragging the pieces around. Double click to select a piece. Use a screenshot to save the image. (Win-PrtScn or Fn-Win-Space on Windows, Shift-Cmd-4 on Mac)
