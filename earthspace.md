## Earth and Space Apps

The apps are sorted by content area and how you might use them. I want to help as many students as possible get a high-quality three-dimensional science education. The apps will always be free. If you find them useful, consider [donating to the Wild Haired Science Teacher on patreon](https://www.patreon.com/whscienceteacher). **You'll support development of more apps!**

ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥UPDATE! I will not be teaching summer school this year so that my free time can be spent on whscience. If you can, please support using the link above.ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

### Virtual Labs/Phenomena
These replicate something like you would get with a hands on lab. Students can change things and see final velocities. 

[Atmosphere](/atmosphere/) - **Earth** - Simulation of light energy interacting with COâ‚‚ in the atmosphere. Shows light of different wavelengths from the sun and infrared leaving. 

[Gravity Assist](/gravityassist/) - **Space** - Students can figure out the conditions for how a spacecraft can use the gravity from a planet to speed up or slow down. 

[ISS Orbit](/issorbit/) - **Space** - Change the velocity of the ISS to make it orbit the Earth. Helps with understanding how an orbit works.

[Moon](/moon/) - **Earth&Space** - App shows the moon, Earth, and sun in a top view and a view of the moon from the Earth. Users can see the change the phase throughout the lunar cycle and how they connect to the location of each body.

[Orbit Examples 1](/orbit1/) - **Space** - Shows four orbits around the Earth including low earth, geostationary, and very elliptical. Good for finding patterns in orbits.

[Orbit Examples 2](/orbit2/) - **Space** - More examples of orbits. Shows a transfer orbit from a close to a far circular orbit. 

[Orbit Sweep](/kepler2/) - **Space** - Eliptical orbit showing a line sweeping out an area. Students can use a ruler to measure triangles to check that the area per time is constant. 

[Planet Energy](/planetenergy/) - **Earth & Space** - Shows the Earth and Mercury change temperature over time. Mercury is hotter during the day but colder at night. I used this phenomenon to start a unit about climate change. Also available as a version that shows photons entering and leaving the planet: [Planet Energy With Light](/plantenergywithlight/). Versions in Â°C: [Without Light](/planetenergyc/) and [with Light](/planetenergywithlightc/). You an also [change the location of the marker on Earth.](planetenergy/planetenergylocation.md)

[Storms](/storms/) - **Energy/Earth & Space** - Students change the temperature of the atmosphere and see the effect on clouds and wind. A very simplified version of a weather simulation. I used this as a summative assessment where students practiced finding patterns and then constructing explanations of why climate change causes more violent storms using ideas about kinetic and potential energy.
