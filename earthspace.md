### Virtual Labs/Phenomena
These replicate something like you would get with a hands on lab. Students can change things and see final velocities. 

[Atmosphere](/atmosphere/) - **Earth&Space** - Simulation of light energy interacting with COâ‚‚ in the atmosphere. Shows light of different wavelengths from the sun and infrared leaving. 

[Gravity Assist](/gravityassist/) - **Earth&Space** - Students can figure out the conditions for how a spacecraft can use the gravity from a planet to speed up or slow down. 

[ISS Orbit](/issorbit/) - **Earth/Space** - Change the velocity of the ISS to make it orbit the Earth. Helps with understanding how an orbit works.

[Orbit Examples 1](/orbit1/) - **Earth&Space** - Shows four orbits around the Earth including low earth, geostationary, and very elliptical. Good for finding patterns in orbits.

[Orbit Examples 2](/orbit2/) - **Earth&Space** - More examples of orbits. Shows a transfer orbit from a close to a far circular orbit. 

[Planet Energy](/planetenergy/) - **Earth&Space** - Shows the Earth and Mercury change temperature over time. Mercury is hotter during the day but colder at night. I used this phenomenon to start a unit about climate change. Also available as a version that shows photons entering and leaving the planet: [Planet Energy With Light](/plantenergywithlight/)

[Storms](/storms/) - **Physics/Earth&Space** - Students change the temperature of the atmosphere and see the effect on clouds and wind. A very simplified version of a weather simulation. I used this as a summative assessment where students practiced finding patterns and then constructing explanations of why climate change causes more violent storms using ideas about kinetic and potential energy.
